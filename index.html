    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 02, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how data is handled in Notify, including data collected by third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>We do not directly collect, store, or share any personal information from users within the App. User preferences and settings are stored locally on your device.</p>

    <p>However, the App utilizes the following third-party services, which may collect and process data:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
            <p>This App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use information such as your device's advertising ID, device information (e.g., device model, operating system), location data (if enabled on your device), and usage data (e.g., ad clicks, ad views) to personalize and deliver ads. This data collection and processing are governed by Google's Privacy Policy, available at: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
            <p>You can manage your ad preferences or opt out of personalized ads through your device settings (Instructions for accessing device settings for ad personalization may vary by device. Please consult your device's help documentation).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Crash Reporting</h3>
          <p>The App uses Android's built-in system-level crash reporting mechanism to help us identify and resolve app issues. This may include information about your device, the App's state at the time of the crash, and crash logs. This data is used solely to improve the App's stability and performance.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>

    <p>As we do not directly collect or store personal data, we rely on the security features of your device's operating system to protect your information. We recommend keeping your device's operating system updated with the latest security patches. Please be aware that third-party services, like AdMob, have their own security measures, which are governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>This App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. Google AdMob also has policies regarding ads served to children, which we encourage you to review.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App or on this page with a revised "Effective Date." Your continued use of the App after the Effective Date constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
